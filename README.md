# Browser Screenshots in OSX

Some basic scripts that open a list of URLs in a web browser and take a screenshot. There's lots of room for improvement, but they work. Feedback is welcome, patches welcome too.

The scripts use a handy utility called GetWindowID https://github.com/smokris/GetWindowID.
You can compile yourself if you prefer.

The scripts in folders onetime-diff and automatic-diff have the following dependancies:

blink-diff - npm install blink-diff

pngjs-image - npm install pngjs-image
